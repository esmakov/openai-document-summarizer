Prepared by: College Center for Advising Services, Lattimore 312 – Revised November 6, 2017
 
Welcome to the Take Five Scholars Program!  You are now part of a select group of students who will enrich their undergraduate programs through a fifth year of study.  Below are the terms for participation in the Take Five J.B. Rodgers, in the Center for Advising Services at jr007h@ur.rochester.edu or 275-2354 (Lattimore 312) if questions or problems arise.  Other advisors available to answer your questions are Lisa Norwood (275-4155, Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) and John Hain (274-1563), Eastman School of Music, Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs).  General questions can also be directed to the Take Five Secretary, Shandra Kieffer 275-2354 (Lattimore 312), Shandra.kieffer@rochester.edu.


I.  THE TAKE FIVE REVIEW BOARD

  The Take Five Review Board is comprised of faculty, administrators, and students who evaluate Take Five proposals and monitor the guidelines of the program.  Each year, we invite fifth-year Take Five Scholars to apply to serve as the student representative on the Review Board.


II. ACADEMIC PROGRESS

Expectations:

  We assume that you will continue to earn satisfactory grades in all your courses.  Failure to do so will result in a review of your Take Five status.  We also assume that you will complete at least 128 credit hours prior to the start of your tuition-free year/semester.  Keep in mind that the Take Five Scholars Program involves the integration of Take Five courses, when possible, into your regular four-year curriculum.  This means that you will replace some of your regular coursework with Take Five courses.  In doing so, you will move some of your graduation requirements — courses needed to satisfy the Rochester Curriculum, major requirements, or electives — into your fifth year/ninth semester.  Note, that courses offered by Medicine & Dentistry, Nursing, Warner, or graduate courses at the Simon School may NOT be taken during a tuition-free semester.  The number of credits earned by the end of the fourth year, however, still should meet the 128 credit hour requirement.  Once you begin your tuition-free fifth year/semester, you must receive final grades for all of your Take Five courses.  Failure to complete your Take Five Scholars Program may delay your graduation and have financial repercussions should you withdraw after beginning the 5th year/tuition-free term(s).

Course Substitutions:

      If you find that you have a scheduling conflict or that one of your proposed Take Five courses is not offered during the semester indicated on your proposal, you need to obtain approval to substitute other courses consistent with the theme of your approved program.  To obtain permission, you must submit a Take Five Petition form, available online at the following website: http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/students/opportunities/takefive/petition.html. The Take Five Review Board assumes that students will follow their approved programs; therefore, it is essential that you discuss any changes you wish to make in your course schedule with the Take Five Program administrator in Lattimore 312 (275-2354).  Any substantial change will require a resubmission of your proposal to the Review Board for re-evaluation, and in such cases approval by the Board cannot be assumed.



VI.  CONCLUSION

  Despite our best efforts to adjust systems to accommodate a fifth year of undergraduate study, some problems may still occur.  Some University divisions keep their own records that are not touched by modifications to the centralized record system, and they may still indicate your original graduation date.  If you encounter any difficulties that result from your special status, please contact the Take Five Program Administrator, who can contact the appropriate people and work with you to resolve the problem.  

Once again, congratulations on your admission to Take Five.  We look forward to working with you on your new program of study.
